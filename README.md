# Color Recognition

In this project, the Neurons learn to recognize the color assigned by the user.


Learning process.
---
User must guess the color (red, green, blue, yellow). This color is not known to the Neurons.
***
The Task class randomly generates one of the allowed colors (red, green, blue, yellow).
***
First Neuron calculates probability of matching the randomly generated color with user's guessed color. The second Neuron calculates probability of not matching.

Neural Network having both calculated probabilities determines - "this color was guess by the user?"
***
The User must evaluate the operation of Neural Network using buttons - Write / Wrong. This action will lead to learning the Neural Network.
